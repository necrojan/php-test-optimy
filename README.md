# PHP test

This is a simple PHP test that leverages the use of OOP and PS4-4 Autoloader.
It uses packages like `doctrine/orm`, `doctrine/dbal` to name a few.

This was built from the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/valet" target="_blank">Laravel Valet</a> environment
so this can be accessed via `PHP_Test_Optimy`
### Installation

```
composer install
```
  - import the dbdump.sql in the "phptest" database
```

```
  - Fill in the necessary db credentials to the `.env` file.
